# Boids

The Boids algorithm, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates the collective behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. It is based on three simple rules: 
- Separation: avoiding collisions with nearby individuals.
- Alignment (matching the direction of neighbors).
- Cohesion (moving toward the groupâ€™s center).

These local interactions create realistic group dynamics without centralized control. Boids has applications in animations, robotics, and drone swarms, where autonomous coordination and adaptive, resilient behavior are essential.
