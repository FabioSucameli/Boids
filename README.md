# Boids

The Boids algorithm, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates the collective behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. It is based on three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: Avoiding collisions with nearby individuals.
2. **Alignment**: Matching the direction of neighbors.
3. **Cohesion**: Moving toward the groupâ€™s center.

These local interactions create realistic group dynamics without centralized control. Boids has applications in animations, robotics, and drone swarms, where autonomous coordination and adaptive, resilient behavior are essential.

## Example Simulation

Below is a demonstration of the Boids algorithm in action. It simulates the movement of 50 boids using the SFML library:

This example showcases how the algorithm achieves realistic group dynamics through simple local rules and demonstrates the potential of SFML for visualizing complex simulations.
